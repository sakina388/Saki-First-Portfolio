<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sakina.<br/>I'm Sakina Bandi, an MBA student specializing in Human Resources at Patna University, currently in my third semester. Alongside my passion for HR, I have a growing interest in coding and web development, which I’m actively learning to complement my HR expertise.<br/><br/>
  I believe in the power of technology to transform traditional HR practices, making processes more efficient and data-driven. My goal is to merge my HR knowledge with technical skills to create innovative solutions that enhance employee experiences and organizational effectiveness.

  I’m currently expanding my skill set in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while also exploring Java for backend development. This unique combination of HR and tech positions me to be a dynamic contributor in any forward-thinking organization.
  
  When I’m not immersed in my studies or coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, working on collaborative projects, and sharing insights on how technology can revolutionize HR.</p>
